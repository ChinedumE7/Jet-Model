In this project, I designed and assembled a Jet airplane inspired by the Gulfstream G800 in SolidWorks. I created the wings, tail, and horizontal stabilizers from NACA 0012 airfoil cross-sections. I intended to 3-d print this as a personal model, so the dimensions are scaled down as compared to real life.
